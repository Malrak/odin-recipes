        <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>2 Cups (240 g) All-Purpose Einkorn Flour <em>or</em> 2½ Cups (240 g) Whole Wheat Einkorn Flour</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons Granulated Sugar</li>
                <li>2 Teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
                <li>½ Teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
                <li>½ Teaspoon Salt</li>
                <li>1 Cup (240 g) Milk</li>
                <li>1 Cup (230 g) Yogurt</li>
                <li>6 Tablespoons (84 g) Unsalted Butter, Melted</li>
                <li>3 Large Eggs, Separated</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 300°F degrees. Place a baking sheet in the oven.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, yogurt, butter, and egg yolks.</li>
                <li>Whisk the flour mixture into the wet ingredients until smooth.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a wire whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Use a rubber
                spatula to gently fold the egg whites into the waffle batter until just mixed.</li>
                <li>For large Belgian waffles, spread 1 cup of the batter nearly to the edges of the waffle iron. For regular waffles, use ½ cup of batter.</li>
                <li>Bake using a medium-high setting for approximately 4 minutes, or until the waffles are deeply golden and crisp.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately with maple syrup, or keep warm in the oven until ready to serve.</li>
            </ol>
