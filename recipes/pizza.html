            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl or stand mixer bowl, add the warm water and yeast. Stir until dissolved.</li>
                <li>Combine the flour and salt together in a separate bowl.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the flour and salt mix into the wet ingredients until a dough forms.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using a stand mixer? Mix on low using a dough hook for 5–10 mins, until firm, smooth and elastic.</li>
                        <li>Mixing by hand? Stir with a wooden spoon, then knead on a floured surface for 10 mins.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Cover the bowl with a dish towel and let the dough rest and rise for 2 hours, or until it's doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Once the dough has risen, divide it into 3 or 4 equal pieces, depending on the size of pizza you're making.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you divide in 3, you will be able to make 16 inch pizzas (40 cm).</li>
                        <li>If you divide in 4, you will be able to make 12 inch pizzas (30 cm).</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Roll your dough balls until they are perfectly rounded (this will help keep the shape of the base circular during the stretching process).</li>
                <li>Place each ball in a separate bowl or tray, cover with a dish towel and leave to rise in a wam place for another 30 to 60 minutes, or until doubled 
                in size.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you're freezing dough balls for later use, pop them in individual bags and freeze them at this point.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>When the dough balls have risen, place one of them on a lightly floured surface, flour your hands and use your fingertips to press the dough into a 
                small, flat disc.</li>
                <li>Working from the center, push the dough outwards while spreading your fingers, making the disc slightly bigger. Pick up the disc and gently stretch 
                all around the edge, allowing gravity to pull it downwards into a circle.</li>
                <li>Once the dough ball is fully stretched, lightly flour your pizza peel and lay the pizza base on it.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If at this point you see any small holes in the dough, gently but securely pinch them back together.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Add your toppings.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Always make sure your oven is hot enough before adding toppings to your pizza base.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>When your oven is hot enough, slide your pizza in it.</li>
                <li>Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, turning every 20 seconds to ensure an even bake.</li>
            </ol>
